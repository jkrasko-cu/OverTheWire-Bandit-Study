# OverTheWire Bandit: Developing Linux Skills
## Overview

This repository will be my notes and documentation through the Bandit wargames from OverTheWire.
The levels will teach me practical techniques in pentesting, incident response, and cybersecurity as a whole. 
As the write-ups progress, they will delve more into practical real-world applications these skills can be applied in.

## Progress
- Levels: 10/34
- Currently working on: Level 11

## Concepts and Skills by Levels
**The Basics You'd Find in an Intro Course:**
- [Level0 -> Level1](levels/level00-01.md): Reading a file
- [Level1 -> Level2](levels/level01-02.md): Reading a file with special characters
- [Level2 -> Level3](levels/level02-03.md): Reading a file with spaces
- [Level3 -> Level4](levels/level03-04.md): Viewing hidden files

**File Searching:**
- Level4 -> Level5 (levels/level04-05.md): Identifying file types using `file`
- Level5 -> Level6 (levels/level05-06.md): Specific file searches using `find`
- Level6 -> Level7 (levels/level06-07.md): Finding files server-wide

**Text Processing:**
- Level7 -> Level8 (levels/level07-08.md): Using `grep` to search through text files
- Level8 -> Level9 (levels/level08-09.md): Finding unique lines using `sort` and `uniq`
- Level9 -> Level10 (levels/level09-10.md): Weeding out unreadable binary text using `strings`

**Decoding:**
- Level10 -> Level11 (levels/level10-11.md): Decoding files which are base64 encoded

## Key Skills Developed
- Relevant Linux knowledge (`find`, `grep`, `strings`, `base64`)
- File system navigation/searching
- Pattern matching with regex
- Binary character handling and encoding
- Cybersecurity problem-solving methodologies
